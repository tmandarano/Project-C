<h2>2. DESCRIPTION OF LIVEGATHER SERVICES</h2>

LiveGather assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion,
mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization
settings. You are responsible for obtaining access to the LiveGather Services,

provider or airtime charges). You are responsible for those fees, including
those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In
addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to
access the LiveGather Services.</p>

<p>You understand that the technical processing and transmission of the
LiveGather Services, including your Content, may involve (a) transmissions

information about yourself as prompted by the LiveGather Serviceâ€™s
registration form (the &ldquo;Registration Data&rdquo;) and (b) maintain and

has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all
current or future use of the LiveGather Services (or any portion thereof).</p>

<p>LiveGather is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users,

this, some content may not be suitable for children under the age of 13.</p>

<h2>4. LIVEGATHER PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<p>Registration Data and certain other information about you are subject to
our applicable privacy policy. For more information, see the full LiveGather

<h2>5. MEMBER ACCOUNT, PASSWORD AND SECURITY</h2>

<p>The LiveGather Services consist of personalized content that you can access

same account that you first used to sign in. For example, if you register
using your Google username and password, then every time you want to log into
your account you will use your Google username and password. LiveGather does
not give you your own username and password, but does create a LiveGather
account for you using information supplied to us by the third-party you select

confidentiality of the password and account and are fully responsible for all
activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a)
immediately notify LiveGather of any unauthorized use of your account or any

all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over the parties by such courts

exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a
